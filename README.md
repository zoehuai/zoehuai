  <div align="left">
  📚 I acquired advanced technical skills during my master's degree, where I gained expertise in Object-Oriented Programming, Java, Python, SQL and information visualisation tools such as Tableau and R. <br>
  <br>
    
  👩‍💼 I gained industry-standard technical skills from my 3 yrs work, implementing JavaScript, **TypeScript**, **React** and system design. In my personal projects, I acquired knowledge of **Node.js**, NoSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, **AWS** services, **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.

  ⚽️ Outside of tech, I enjoy soccer games and workouts, I'm a big fan of Barça and Arsenal Football Club. I also make music when I'm feeling bored, and feel free to chat if we have the same interests!
